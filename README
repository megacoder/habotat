			       HABOTAT
		      A home for all your Bots.

OVERVIEW
========

Habotat is a miniature application server for hosting Instant
Messenger Bots. These are essentially small applications that you can
interact with using an IM client.

Currently, Habotat supports the following IM protocols:

* AOL Instant Messenger (OSCAR protocol)
* Jabber (including GoogleTalk)
* Yahoo Instant Messenger

Support for each of the above protocols is made possible through these fine
libraries:

daim  - https://daim.dev.java.net/
Smack - http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/
jYMSG - http://jymsg9.sourceforge.net/

Limitations in the Yahoo protocol make it ill-suited for this type of
use, but it is nevertheless functional for simple Bots.

Additional protocols may be supported in the future.

Habotat also depends on these additional open-source projects:

Kiwi - http://hyperrealm.com/main.php?s=kiwi
JDOM - http://www.jdom.org/


LICENSE
=======

Habotat is distributed under the GNU General Public License. See the
file `COPYING' for the license terms.

Habotat is "free" but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to make a
monetary contribution if you find this software useful.


INSTALLATION
============

Habotat was developed on Linux and thus the build files are all built
around the GNU autotools. I recognize that this is a problem for
people running on Windows, but I absolutely loathe 'Ant'. However, if
someone would like to contribute (and maintain) Ant scripts for this
project, I'd be happy to include them in the installation.

In the following discussion, "<install-prefix>" refers to the desired
base directory for your installation, for example "/usr/local" or
"/usr/local/habotat".

To build the software, make sure that you have a JDK installed and
that the directory containing 'javac', 'jar', etc., is in your
PATH. Since the code uses generics and other features which are only
present in JDK 1.5, you must use that version (or a later version).

Note that OS X comes with JDK 1.4 installed by default, so you must
download the JDK 1.5 update from Apple. The directory structure of
Apple's JDK distribution is different from that of Sun's; to make it
work with the build files, do the following:

1. Set the JDK_HOME environment variable to the following path:
   /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5/

2. Create a symbolic link in the aforementioned directory as follows:
   cd /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5/
   sudo ln -s Commands bin


To build and install the package, simply do the traditional:

./configure --prefix=<install-prefix>
make
make install

To start the server:

<install-prefix>/bin/habotat.sh


GETTING STARTED
===============

The first time you start the server, you will be greeted with a setup
wizard. Here you must specify the directory where Habotat will store
its data files.

Once you've completed the setup steps, take the following steps to
create your first bot:

1. Open the IM Adapters dialog ("IM Adapters..." under the "Edit"
menu).  Click [+] to add a new adapter. Browse to the directory
<install-prefix>/lib/habotat/adapters and select the appropriate IM
adapter for the protocol you wish to use. You may repeat this step for
the remaining adapters.

2. Click on the "New" button on the "Accounts" tab and enter the
details for your IM account.

3. Click on the [+] button on the "Plugins" tab to add a new bot
plugin.  Browse to the directory <install-prefix>/lib/habotat/bots and
select the appropriate Plugin for the bot you wish to create. You may
repeat this step for the remaining bot plugins.

4. Click on the "New" button on the "Bots" tab and enter the details
for your new Bot.

That's it! Now you can click the "Start Bot" button on the "Bots" tab
to run your bot.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

After configuring the project, you may generate javadoc API documentation
by issuing the following commands:

cd server
make javadoc

A complete manual will be written at some point, when there is time.


NOTES
=====

This is a very young project, and has a long way to go before it is
considered "release quality." I maintain quite a few open source
projects, and have a full-time job on top of that, and Habotat is not
presently at the top of my list of priorities.  If you are interested
in contributing to this project, please contact me at the address
below. See the file "TODO" for a list of things that need some
immediate attention.
