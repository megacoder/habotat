    The Habotat project came about as a result of my interest in
    autonomous software agents. The Instant Messenger has become one
    of those ubiquitous applications, and as such, it is the ideal
    vehicle for delivering smart agent functionality to anyone, at any
    time.

    <p>

      Habotat is fully extensible. It provides simple, straightforward
      APIs for writing both Bots and IM adapters. The package includes
      some useful pre-built Bots, but the real fun lies in creating your
      own.
